Implementation for [101 Companies](http://101companies.org/).

# Requirements

You'll need a Perl6 to run this. It was tested using
[Rakudo](http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo/). No modules are required, so
plain Rakudo is enough, you don't necessarily need Rakudo Star.

# Testing

Just run [test](test). Alternatively, you can just `make` and it'll execute the
script with `prove` for you.
